This manual documents the usage of the "Compat" Emacs lisp library,
the forward-compatibility library for Emacs Lisp, corresponding to
version {{{version}}}.

#+texinfo: @insertcopying

* Introduction
** Overview
The objective of Compat is to provide "forwards compatibility"
library for Emacs Lisp.  That is to say by using Compat, an Elisp
package does not have to make the decision to either use new and
useful functionality or support old versions of Emacs.

Version 24.3 is chosen as the oldest version, because this is the
newest version on CentOS 7. It is intended to preserve compatibility
for at least as the Centos 7 reaches [[https://wiki.centos.org/About/Product][EOL]], 2024.

If you are developing a package with Compat in mind, consider loading
=compat-help= (on your system, not in a package) to get relevant notes
inserted into the help buffers of functions that are implemented or
advised in Compat.

Note that Compat provides a few prefixed function, ie. functions with
a ~compat-~ prefix.  These are used to provide extended functionality
for commands that are already defined (~sort~, ~assoc~, ~seq~, ...).
It might be possible to transform these into advised functions later
on, so that the modified functionality is accessible without a prefix.
Feedback on this point is appreciated.

** Usage
The intended use-case for this library is for package developers to
add as a dependency in the header:

: ;; Package-Requires: ((emacs "24.3") (compat "28.1.2.0"))

and later on a

: (require 'compat)

This will load all non-prefixed definitions (functions and macros with
a leading =compat-=).  To load these, an additional

: (require 'compat-XY) ; e.g. 26

will be necessary, to load compatibility code for Emacs version XY.

It is recommended to subscribe to the [[https://lists.sr.ht/~pkal/compat-announce][compat-announce]] mailing list to
be notified when new versions are released or relevant changes are
made.

*** Additional libraries
These libraries are packages with Compat, but are disabled by default.
To use them you can use ~M-x load-library~:

- compat-help :: Add notes to ~*Help*~ buffer, if a compatibility
  definition has something to warn you about.
- compat-font-lock :: Highlight functions that are implemented as
  compatibility definitions.

** Intentions
The library intends to provide support back until Emacs 24.3.  The
intended audience are package developers that are interested in using
newer developments, without having to break compatibility.

Sadly, total backwards compatibility cannot be provided for technical
reasons.  These might include:

- An existing function or macro was extended by some new functionality.  To
  support these cases, the function or macro would have to be advised.
  As this is usually regarded as invasive and is shown to be a
  significant overhead, even when the new feature is not used, this
  approach is not used.

  As a compromise, prefixed functions and macros (starting with a
  ~compat-~ prefix) can be provided.

- New functionality was implemented in the core, and depends on
  external libraries that cannot be reasonably duplicated in the scope
  of a compatibility library.

- New functionality depends on an entire new, non-trivial library.
  Sometimes these are provided via ELPA (xref, project, ...), but other
  times it would be infeasible to duplicate an entire library within
  Compat while also providing the necessary backwards compatibility.

- It just wasn't added, and there is no good reason (though good
  excuses might exist).  If you happen to find such a function,
  [[*Development][reporting]] it would be much appreciated.

  Always begin by assuming that this might be the case, unless proven
  otherwise.

* Support
This section goes into the features that Compat manages and doesn't
manage to provide for each Emacs version.

* Development
Compat is developed on [[https://sr.ht/~pkal/compat][SourceHut]]. A restricted [[https://github.com/phikal/compat.el][GitHub mirror]] is also
maintained.

Patches and comments can be sent to the [[https://lists.sr.ht/~pkal/compat-devel][development mailing list]]
([[mailto:~pkal/compat-devel@lists.sr.ht][~pkal/compat-devel@lists.sr.ht]]).  Bug reports are best sent to the
[[https://todo.sr.ht/~pkal/compat][issue tracker]] ([[mailto:~pkal/compat@todo.sr.ht][~pkal/compat@todo.sr.ht]]).  The GitHub mirror can also
be used to submit patches.  These may include issues in the
compatibility code, missing definitions or performance issues.

Please note that as a GNU ELPA package, Compat requires contributors
to have signed the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copyright-Assignment.html][FSF copyright assignment]], before any non-trivial
contribution (roughly 15 lines of code) can be applied.
