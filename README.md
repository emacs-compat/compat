COMPATibility Library for Emacs

This is the source of compat.el, the forwards-compatibility library for (GNU)
Emacs Lisp, versions 24.4 and newer. The intended audience are package
developers that are interested in using newer developments, without having to
break compatibility.

For information on how to use Compat, please consult the [manual]. The latest
state of development can be found in the [snapshot version] of the manual.
